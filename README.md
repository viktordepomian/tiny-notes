### **Why This Exists**  
- **No BS**: The internet has 10,000 bloated note apps. This one is *stupid simple*.  
- **Offline First**: Your data lives in your browser (and your soul).  
- **For Makers**: Code poets, overthinkers, and midnight idea hoarders.

### **Features**  
- 📝 **Minimalist AF** – No distractions, just text.  
- ⚡ **Auto-save** – Every keystroke is sacred (LocalStorage, 1s interval).  
- 🌓 **Dark/Light Mode** – Because eyeballs deserve options.  
- 📥 **Export as .txt** – Your words, your control.  
- ✨ **Word Counter** – For when you need to lie to yourself about "progress".
